## Face Mask Detection Using MobileNetV2

This a Intelligent Face Mask Detection system to track whether a person is wearing a Face Mask or not in Real Time Environmnent. This model was built using the following packages:
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Scikit-learn
* OpenCV 

This CNN based model uses the MobileNetV2 Architecture due to it's light weight, fewer parameters and high accuracy. The Real Time environment is built using the OpenCV package.
